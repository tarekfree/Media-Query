    <h1 class="head">MEDIA QUERY</h1>

    <p>Media queries were first sketched in Hakon Wium Lie's initial CSS proposal in 1994,[2] but they did not become part of CSS 1. The HTML4 Recommendation from 1997 shows an example of how media queries could be added in the future.[3] In 2000, W3C started work on media queries and also on another scheme for supporting various devices: CC/PP. The two address the same problem, but CC/PP is server-centric, while media queries are browser-centric.[4] The first public working draft for media queries was published in 2001,[5] and the specification became a W3C Recommendation in 2012 after browsers added support.</p>
